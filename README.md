# Udacity-Face-Generation
This notebook shows the implementation and training process of a GAN to be able to generate realistic looking images of faces.

This notebook and associated files form the face generation project which was part of the udacity Deep Learning Nano Degree.

We use a Generator and a Discriminator to be able to learn what a face should look like, then generate images of new previously unseen ones

The model architecture used in this project is a GAN.
